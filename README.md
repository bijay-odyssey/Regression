### üìä Regression Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of machine learning projects focused on **Regression tasks**. This repository serves as a central hub for various datasets and models I've developed. Each sub-directory contains a complete project, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing to model training, fine tuning and evaluation.

It includes wide range of Regression techniques applied to different real-world problems.

### üìÇ Repository Structure

The projects are organized into sub-directories based on the dataset used. Each project folder is self-contained and includes:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Files documenting the full machine learning workflow.
- **Model Files**: Saved fine tuned models, pipelines, and scalers (`.joblib` or `.pkl`).
- **Data Files**: The dataset used for the project.

List of the current and planned projects in this repository:

| Project Directory | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `housePricesModel/` | Predicting House's  SalePrice. | **Complete** |
